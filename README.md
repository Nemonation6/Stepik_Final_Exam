# Testing an online store http://selenium1py.pythonanywhere.com
Hi!  
There are checklists, test cases and autotests (Python + Pytest + Selenium WebDriver) for the test store.
## Autotests
The autotests support chrome and firefox browsers (called from the command line --browser=chrome --browser=firefox respectively, by default chrome), 
as well as the user language can be changed with the command --language="en, es, fr, ..."   
  
  
P.S. The test cases from the file and autotests do not yet match.
